# .github

This organization is basically a storage area for archived repositories during the developments of the NWChemEx software.  Most of the code is from prototypes that were used to try out algorithms, but that were not used in the end. The code is saved here to decrease distractions in [the NWChemEx-Community organization](https://github.com/NWChemEx).
