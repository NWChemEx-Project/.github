## Welcome to the NWChemEx archive organization 👋

This organization is basically a storage area for archived repositories during the developments of the NWChemEx software.  
Most of the code is from prototypes that were used to try out algorithms, but that were not used in the end. 
The code is saved here to decrease distractions in [the NWChemEx-Community organization](https://github.com/NWChemEx).

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
